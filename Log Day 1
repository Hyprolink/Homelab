I am beginning this repository / documentation rather late into my homelabbing process, as much has already been done...

By this point, I have been actively homelabbing for about 4 month's time, not the worst!

Due to living with my parents, I operate under my own subnet and have to work with an extender rather than an administrative router. That said, I worked with what I have and configured my firewalls local to my devices.

My setup constitutes of many separate and integrated aspect, as well as a plethora of logical connections which use layers 1, 2, and 3 of the OSI model. Some of these include a semi-mesh network with Cat6 cabling schemes, 
hub-and-spoke/peer-to-peer wireless connections, an unmanaged network switch with PoE and link aggregation, HDDs, M.2. NVME SSDs, DDR4 and DDR5 RAM, mid-high end GPUs, USB hubs, and many peripherals.

I supplement my electronic end of my homelab with functional 3D prints for decor and functionality, bridging my tech together and creating new use cases and ways to integrate my network;
designing things such as phone stands via multiboards and sliding mini-shelves, fitted with structual supports and 3D-printed hooks for angle maintenance,

Functional eperimentation is also a huge thing for me, my mouse has many buttons for inputs, as does my Azeron Cyborg II keypad. I like to see how I can work with many options and innovate my playstyle and productivity.
It was during this process I had set binds for every buton on the devices, as well as building myself a functional Samba (SMB) file sharing server between my two personal computers, operating with my dual-boot 
Windows 11 and Ubuntu Linux desktop on the Linux end. I configured the subnet with static IPs, applied DNS configurations, and established 2 functional file share servers off of each drive for my Windows 11 laptop and dual-boot desktop
